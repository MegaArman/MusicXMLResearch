# xml_parser_performance
Here I am creating a class which can search the JS object representation of a MusicXML score for meaningful info.
See the xml2js_test for info on how MusicXML is being represented as a JS object.

### Setup
1) Download this directory (no parent directories needed). 

2) Use npm install to get dependencies listed in package.json

### Execution 
 node --use_strict ScoreSearcherTester.js
