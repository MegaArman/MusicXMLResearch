# browser_app
This code shows how to create a browser app as opposed to a node based app using the ScoreSearcher class, namely browserify allows require statements to work in browser and the web page uses the FileReader API to allow the user to input a file. 

xml2js works in browser as it is a JavaScript based parser- this may not be the case for other parsers downloaded via NPM

### Setup
1) Download this directory (no parent directories needed). 

2) Use npm install to get dependencies listed in package.json

### Adding/Changing Code
change a file other than bundle.js and run 'npm run build'
(see package.json and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTAa8IcQh1U&index=1&list=PLiyLAgiWnfNH2rlMV7LdZSwnvBGQRoq-Z if confused)
